Mike, I love this idea. It's particularly interesting in that it
attempts to solve a problem with Hype Machine's current product. The
collaborative filtering method that HM uses to surface new music seems
to work well under the assumption that its listeners share mutual
interests (or in the very limited goal of surfacing only the songs that
the ENTIRE userbase likes the most), but will be more problematic as the
volume and diversity of its users grow. Of course, it will still function
to surface "hyped" content, but to succeed as a personal song recommender, it would
need to adopt some type of content based filtering (or else become more targeted
with its collaborative recommendations). This makes your project
extremely topical and interesting.

I don't think that there will be an issue with data volume, especially
as you have so much good data available in the song tags. I'm also
curious to see more of how (source) sitename correlates with your
liked/loved tracks. Based on this data, are there a few particular sites
that continually provide music that you enjoy? If there are, it might be
interesting to give those sites a little bit of extra weight in the
prediction of whether a particular new song will be liked/loved.

The last item that I'm curious about is how date/time impacts your music
preferences. You have several years of data, and even though it's
somewhat inconsistent in terms of date, it would be interesting to
consider evolving music tastes. Do your current like/love predictions get any
more accurate if you restrict the dataset to a recent time period?
Similarly, can you pick any given time period from your data as a
reference point and use that to predict near future likes with greater
accuracy?
