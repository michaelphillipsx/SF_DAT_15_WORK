July 1 (Mandatory): Question and Data Set

What is the question you hope to answer? What data are you planning to use to answer that question? What do you know about the data so far? Why did you choose this topic?


I am planning to build a model that will examine historic NCAA basketball data in order to predict March Madness performance. 

There is a high volume of data available at http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/ -- including over 100 years of in-depth team, player, and coaching stats, as well as regional and national tournament data for all years when tournaments were held.

I haven’t decided exactly which fields to use, but I would definitely like to involve data at the team and individual player level. At a very high level, this model will digest some number of fields in order to assign a ‘score’ to a team in a given contest. As the teams enter the tournament, the scores will be used to determine who the likely winner will be in a game between any two given teams.

I chose this topic because of how pertinent/interesting sports data is to most people, as well as the specific popularity of attempting to predict the outcomes of the NCAA tournament games. Additionally, the marketing team at my company made an attempt at something similar last year using relatively arbitrary data like coaching staff salaries, and I believe that I can build something much more robust than what they came up with.
