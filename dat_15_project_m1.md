July 1 (Mandatory): Question and Data Set

What is the question you hope to answer? What data are you planning to use to answer that question? What do you know about the data so far? Why did you choose this topic?

Example:

I'm planning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
I have Kaggle's Titanic dataset with 10 passenger characteristics.
I know that many of the fields have missing values, that some of the text fields are messy and will require cleaning, and that about 38% of the passengers in the training set survive.
I chose this topic because I'm fascinated by the history of the Titanic.
